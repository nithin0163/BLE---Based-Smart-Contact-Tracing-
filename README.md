The world is currently experiencing the worst public health crisis in more than a century 
due to the new coronavirus epidemic. The rapid spread of coronavirus transport highly 
infectious microbes greatly affects public health. Keeping an appropriate social distance is 
crucial to manage the worldwide pandemic crisis and stop the virus from spreading. Before 
symptoms appear, an individual with the coronavirus is infectious to others for up to two 
days. This progressive condition affects more than 70% of the world population and is 
currently in its rise. But manual contact tracing is inefficient and time-consuming. We 
know that machine learning has the ability to track the human contact that stops the 
spreading of this deadly disease. Thus, a Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system is proposed 
that uses machine learning classifiers and Bluetooth low energy signals (BLE) from 
smartphones to automatically identify those potential encounters with infected people. Each 
smartphone determines its distance from other users' phones using the received signal 
strength and sends out instant notifications when social distance norms are broken. This 
paper uses Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), 
k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to predict the 
required social distance between two users over six different positions of smartphones to 
classify the user as high-risk or low-risk.
